# TypeScript

> _JavaScript that scales_

TypeScript is a **superset of JavaScript**, meaning that everything JavaScript can do, TypeScript can do (and better).

> Superset
> : a set which includes another set or sets. In this case, the entire set of things possible in JavaScript is included as a small part of the larger set of things possible with TypeScript.

## Goals

TypeScript was meant to solve two problems:

1. Provide JavaScript developers with an **optional type system**.
2. Provide JavaScript developers with the ability to utilize planned features from **future JavaScript editions** against **current JavaScript engines**.
